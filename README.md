My Python-based portfolio web page built on Flask with custom styling.

## Features

- Dynamic server-side filtering with Flask
- Client-side animations with Javascript
- Desktop & mobile friendly UI
- Contact form with serverless integration through Formspree
  
---

## Deployment Pipeline (CI/CD)

This app auto-deploys to [Render](https://render.com) on every push to `main`.

- CI/CD powered by GitHub + Render
- Deployment config stored in [`render.yaml`](./render.yaml)
- Zero-downtime deploys with automatic rebuilds
- Allows for multi-platform deployment potential through addition of Procfile
